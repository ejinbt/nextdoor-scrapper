## Run Locally
+ Put profile links in profiles.txt file
+ you need to type your account email and password , then only bot can access the nextdoor website to scrape (you can use the one you given to me)
+ type your email and password in credentials.txt file
+ first line should contain email and second line should contain password
+ then run the code below
```bash
  python main.py
```
+ when the program is done  , a output.csv file will be generated

## Some things to note while using this scrapper
+ scrapper is made to be little slow to overcome nextdoor from restrict our bot
+ ignore the text in console unless the program is not working as expected
+ it is better to scrape by little by little , eg:- 20 links first than 20 links after
+ nextdoor has tight protection against scrapper , so it might restrict the bot if you scrape in bulk in small period of time
